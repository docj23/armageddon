Red Team Deliverables (What They Submit)
Deliverable 1 — “Red Packet” (Evidence Bundle)

Folder structure (required):

  01_target_map.md
  02_activity_log.csv
  03_findings/
     F001_*.md
     F002_*.md

     ai/

Deliverable 2 — Findings (Minimum 8)

Each finding must use this format:

Finding ID: F00X
Category: OWASP A0X
Severity: High/Med/Low
What we observed: (facts only)
Evidence: (file paths, command outputs)
Impact: (what could happen)
Root cause: (why it exists)
Fix recommendation: (specific, minimal)
Verification step: (how Blue Team can confirm fix)

Deliverable 3 — “Blue Team Handoff”
A one-page brief:
    Top 3 risks to fix first
    One “fast remediation”
    One “requires design change”
    One “monitoring gap”

Constraints That Make This Professional 
1) No “spray and pray”
You are graded on clarity, not noise.

2) No hero mode
If you can’t prove it with evidence, it doesn’t count.

3) No illegal or unsafe fixes
Red Team must never recommend:
    storing PHI outside Japan
    turning off logging
    exposing DB publicly “for testing”
    bypassing identity controls

4) Respect production discipline
Even in a lab, act like it’s real:
    small changes
    clear notes
    reproducible steps


Why This Matters to Your Career

Most engineers can “run a scanner.”
Very few can produce:
    a clean evidence packet
    a prioritized risk narrative
    a remediation plan that doesn’t break compliance
    a handoff Blue Team can execute

That skill set is what separates:

“I ran tools”
from
“I reduced risk in a defensible way.”
